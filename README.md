  <h3> <i> A REALIZATION.</i> </h3>
  <p title="Dabi-ging of a new Shiggy life style">
    i have discovered a new husbo to simp over today in our minecraft server. His name is Tomura Shigaraki. He is a pure Crusty Dusty boi and my friend can voice him very well. i am jealous of their voice acting skills and sometimes i wanna punch them with love and affection.</p>

  <p>ANOTHER HALF AN HOUR HAS PASSED. And i am still simping for Shigaraki, i have created a drawing to talk about our lord and savor Tomura Shigaraki with all of his dusty, no eyebrow self. I have also thought about what kind of animal he would be, and i was blessed with the thought that he would be a hairless cat that scratches anyone that gets near him. Poor baby.</p>
